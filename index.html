                    <h1>                                                            Hi! I'm Mia Yafei Ge (葛雅妃)</h1>

                    <p>
                        I'm a final-year undergraduate student at 
                        <a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) </a>
                        and supervised by 
                        <a href="https://designschool.sustech.edu.cn/cn" target="_blank">Prof. Xueliang Li</a>.
                        I have a strong interest in <b>Human-Computer Interaction</b>, especially in the context of neurodiversity, mental health, and chronic illness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My recent work has focused on exploring how interactive systems can be designed to better support marginalized communities—
                        particularly individuals living with invisible disabilities or emotional sensitivity. I’m especially drawn to affective design
                        and the ways technology can be more empathetic, inclusive, and responsive to diverse cognitive and emotional needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through my research and design practice, I aim to bridge the gap between accessibility and emotional well-being,
                        contributing to more ethical and human-centered design approaches. I'm currently preparing to apply for a Master’s or PhD
                        program where I can further explore these themes and collaborate with researchers working at the intersection of HCI,
                        healthcare, and inclusive design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m always happy to exchange ideas, learn from others, and connect with people who share similar interests.
                    </p>
                     <p>
